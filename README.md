# 🎯 Minesweeper Game

## 🎉 Introduction

Welcome to my Minesweeper game! Inspired by childhood memories of playing without fully knowing the rules, this project brings a fresh take on the classic puzzle game. Now that I’ve grown and understood the mechanics better, I designed this version to be both nostalgic and exciting, packed with classic gameplay, custom difficulties, timed challenges, unique power-ups, multiple themes, and handy quality-of-life features.

## 🌟 Features & Gameplay Highlights

Growing up, I played Minesweeper without really understanding all the rules. Now, with a deeper knowledge and appreciation, I made this game to capture the fun and challenge of Minesweeper, with some modern twists:

* ❤️‍🩹 **Power-Ups:**

    * ❤️❤️❤️ 2 Extra Lives - keep playing even after a mine hit
    * 🛡️ Shield - blocks one mine hit and reveals surrounding tiles
    * 🔍 Reveal - uncovers a random mine on the board
    * 👣 3 Safe Steps - guarantees your next three moves are mine-free


* 🎵 **Immersive 8-bit Sounds & Dynamic Music:** The soundtrack changes as you uncover more tiles, enhancing the atmosphere.
