# 🎯 Minesweeper Game

## 🎉 Introduction

Welcome to my Minesweeper game! Inspired by childhood memories of playing without fully knowing the rules, this project brings a fresh take on the classic puzzle game. Now that I’ve grown and understood the mechanics better, I designed this version to be both nostalgic and exciting, packed with classic gameplay, custom difficulties, timed challenges, unique power-ups, multiple themes, and handy quality-of-life features.  

This project was developed in **Java with Swing** during my **Erasmus semester** in my **second year of university** as part of the **Programming in Java Language** course.
